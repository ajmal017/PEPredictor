===========

Parses through a CSV file containing Stock Attributes (Return, Volatility, Relative Strength etc) for SP500 Tickers. Uses the KNN Algorithm to find the nearest neighbor for a given stock and determines its Predicted ratios (P/E, P/B and P/S).

To Do:

1) Plot a pie chart for the influencing neighbors with their relavent percentage influences.

2) Implement a webservice call to retrieve real time CSV files containing the data from FinViz.
